```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
#A random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution
runif(10,0,5)  
# the runif function provide information about the uniform distribution on the interval from min to max. In this case sample size is 10,min=0 max=5 
```

```{r}
#A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
compare2<-c(1,2,3,4,5)  
compare2>2  # this line compare each elements in vector compare2 to 2 one by one. If an element is greater than 2 R will return TRUE otherwise it will return FALSE
# output: FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE
# this code 
```

```{r}
#A (length-10) character vector
alphabet<-c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j")

```

```{r}

```
