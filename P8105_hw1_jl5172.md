When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
#A random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution
random10<-runif(10,0,5)  
# the runif function provide information about the uniform distribution on the interval from min to max. In this case sample size is 10,min=0 max=5 
```

``` r
#A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
compare2<-c(1,2,3,4,5)  
compare2>2  # this line compare each elements in vector compare2 to 2 one by one. If an element is greater than 2 R will return TRUE otherwise it will return FALSE
```

    ## [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE

``` r
# output: FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE
# this code 
```

``` r
#A (length-10) character vector
alphabet<-c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j")
```

``` r
#A (length-10) factor vector
# the vector named student contains set of numeric codes with character-valued levels
student = factor(c(1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1),levels = c(0,1),labels = c("male","female"))
```

Mean of vectors

``` r
mean(random10)
```

    ## [1] 2.556008

``` r
mean(compare2)
```

    ## [1] 3

``` r
mean(alphabet)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(alphabet): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(student)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(student): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
# According to the output. Mean can be taken from random10(numeric) and compare2(numeric) 
#but not alphabet(character) and student(factor) since mean function is designed for numeric/logical vectors
```
